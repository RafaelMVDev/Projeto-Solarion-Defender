 <p>This is a 2D game developed in Game Maker over a month and a half as a school project. Inspired by the style of Google's dinosaur game, you play as Cytos, a brave alien whose planet has been invaded by the Nexovirus. <br>Your mission is to survive and defeat the viruses that appear in your path! With a retro visual style and simple yet addictive gameplay, this project was created to test skills in design, programming, and game logic.
